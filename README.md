# DutyCycles.jl

The package DutyCycleNumbers provides a special type of "numbers" for
the programming language [julia](https://julialang.org) that represent
piece-wise constant waveforms, e.g. values that are discontinuous in
time.  This can be rather convenient for modeling electrical equipment
if it is turned on and off with a given dutycycle.  More complex
switching patterns are also possible.
